# -The-Last-Stand-3d-Videogame

This game engine was coded as part of a university project. I programmed the 3rd person camera and gameplay as well as creating many of the objects using OpenGL primitives.

The game utilised multiple instances of game physics and collision detection using the Bullet Physics Engine as well as audio, lighting and the loading in of mesh based objects.

I also included two types of AI enemies using state machines and decision trees to provide a challange to the player.
